Learning Activity: Data Project Practice

Now is your moment to put all you have learned together! In this project, we will begin to remove the training wheels by giving fewer details in the directions. Know that you have all the skills you need to succeed.

Our culminating project is to perform customized analysis on a data set of your choice. Before we go down that road, we will all practice the same set of basic skills on the same dataset which I will provide.

Research Question: How do students in a python class compare to students from a prior semester?

Data file to use for activity: `sample_grades.csv`

Sample output:

```
         Fall 2016   Spring 2016
Mean:       88.38       85.86
Median:     88.5        87.0
STD:         6.41       10.41
```

Write a program that reads in the csv file linked above and outputs the mean, median, and standard deviation for the fall & spring semesters. Make sure to write at least two functions in your final solution. The more generalizable you make your code, the more you may be able to reuse it for your own project later. To receive feedback, please submit a screenshot of your program & its output.
